# SH-Service-Discovery

## Self-Hosted Service Discovery and Service Name Matching using a wordlist.

Q: Why a wordlist?
A: I am not an HTML magician, and using a wordlist is simple in the long run (in my mind).

Define your IP, Ports, and Domains in config.yaml. Supports tailscale and zerotier as long as you run the API on a machine with it installed.

Feel free to fork and change the logic.
