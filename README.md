# SH-Service-Discovery

## Self-Hosted Automated Service Discovery.

I built this for my custom dashboard for a private overlay network with my friends. It works on all networks (should) just define IP, ports, domains, CORS rules in config.yaml.

You can define IP and Port ranges to scan.

This is still heavily work-in-progress. Feel free to fork, change the logic or submit a PR to help.
